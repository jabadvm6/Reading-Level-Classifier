The beginning of the year is probably prime-time for feeling glum about work: it’s ages until the next holiday, and it’s dark in the morning and when you get home. And, if you’re stuck in a job you don’t like, it could be enough to have you reaching for your CV. 
But, before you start hunting through the job ads, try to put things in perspective. So, what else could you be doing instead? We asked ﬁve people doing some unusual jobs how much they are paid, what the worst parts are and why they enjoy their work. 
1. Dog-food taster 
The job: Tasting dog food to make sure it meets a premium brand’s quality standards 
What it involves: Opening sample tins of each freshly made batch of dog (or cat) food, smelling it and eating it. “Although dogs’ palates are different from ours, taste is an important quality check to ensure each different ingredient is perfectly balanced in just the right way,” says Philip Wells, the chief taster for Lily’s Kitchen pet food. “Trying the food is also a good way to pick up on the nuances of the cooking; this works especially well on the dry food.”
